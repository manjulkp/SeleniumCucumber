What is it(Model used )

Selenium POM (Page Object Model) is a Java framework that provides ability to describe your web application as a hierarchy of models. It also adds helper methods for most common functions such us double click, or get value.

1. SeleniumDriver 
- Has the driver initialized for Firefox
-It can be extended to work for browser by adding if statement 
-Has setup and tearDown methods 
- Generic methods created for isElementPresent,Scroll Up ,Scroll Down ,Scroll until an element ......


2. Locators 
The obvious way out to get rid of duplication is to abstract the id's from the methods. An example of that using the signup page class would look like this.
Requirements
Example can be seen under "/Which/src/main/java/pages/locators"
Now if we can call the same locator as many places we need and refer to it by the variable name.Also, if the locator changes we just need to change it at one common place.

3.Page
We are encapsulating all the business logic needed for each screen under
"/Which/src/main/java/pages/actions"

4.FeatureFiles :
All the test cases are written in BDD -gerkin language 

5.Steps:
-convert the feature step into an executable specification using cucumber-jvm.
Every step in the scneario needs to be matched with a glue code for the same.

6.Runner :
Even from the IDE, there are a couple of ways to run these feature files.
Running it by setting the glue code path in Run Configuration setting.
Running it through a specified runner class that can accomodate setting around the feature files and glue code location and much more.

- By testNG
-By Cucumber JVM
-By Maven
